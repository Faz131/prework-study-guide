# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## This is a study guide for new Bootcamp students

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I have always been fascinated about how things are developed.  Wheter it be a website, and application or an award winning videogame.  This bootcamp will be the stepping stone to provide the tools, konwledge and confidence to move that direction.

- Speaking of stepping stones, this project was the first step of many.  It introduced the base development ideas and knowledge needed to understand the broader world of devlopment.

- Often times when trying to learn a new skill or toolset the barrier of entry is difficult to breakthrough.  This study guide will help that barrier become less intimidating.

- I have learned that while it's still a bit of technological magic, web development works as any language does.  There is structure and rules, that all combine to create solid way to convey and communicate ideas.
